# Stimuli. 

We conducted an IRB-approved data collection of the viewport pose for desktop, headset, and phone-based VRs, with open-source VR games from Unity store, containing 1 indoor (Office [1]) and 2 outdoor (Viking village [2], Lite [3]) scenarios. Main characteristics of these VR games with different scene complexities. In desktop VR, rotational and translational movements are made using the mouse and up arrow key. The poses in headset VR are collected with a standalone Oculus Quest 2, where rotational and translational movements are made by moving the head and by using the controller thumbstick. In the phone-based VR, in-lab experiment uses Pixel 2 XL with Android 9, and rotational and translational movements are made by moving the motion-sensor-equipped phone and by tapping on the screen using one finger.


# Procedure.

In desktop VR, the participants are seated in front of a PC, and use the up arrow key and mouse to perform translational and rotational movement, respectively. In headset VR, each participant wears a standalone Oculus Quest 2 headset, and makes rotational movement by moving her head, and makes translational movement using the  controller thumbstick. In phone-based VR, the participant makes rotational movement by moving the motion-sensor-equipped phone, and makes translational movement by tapping on the screen using one finger. Considering the device computation capability and the screen fresh rate, the timestamp and viewport pose of each participant are recorded at a target frame rate of60 Hz, 72 Hz, and 60 Hz for desktop, headset, and phone-based VR, respectively. We randomize the initial viewport position in VR games over the whole bounding area. We fix the initial polar angle of the viewport to be 90 degree, and uniformly randomize the initial azimuth angle on [-180,180) degree.
